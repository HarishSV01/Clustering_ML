# Clustering_ML
This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques (Clustering) using Scikit-learn.

**Problem Statement**

Scaler is an online tech-versity offering intensive computer science & Data Science courses through live classes delivered by tech leaders and subject matter experts.

You are working as a data scientist with the analytics vertical of Scaler, focused on profiling the best companies and job positions to work for from the Scaler database. 

You are provided with the information for a segment of learners and tasked to cluster them on the basis of their job profile, company, and other features.

The goal is to group learners with similar characteristics.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Learnings:**
- How scaling impacts clustering algorithms.
- Choosing the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- Visualizing high-dimensional data.

**Dataset:**

Dataset Link: scaler_kmeans.csv

ðŸ“˜**Data Dictionary :**

â€˜Unnamed 0â€™ - Index of the dataset

Email_hash - Anonymised Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

Company_hash - This represents an anonymized identifier for the company, which is the current employer of the learner.

orgyear - Employment start date

CTC - Current CTC

Job_position - Job profile in the company

CTC_updated_year - Year in which CTC got updated (Yearly increments, Promotions)


ðŸ§® **Concepts Used :**

-Data Scaling and Normalization

-Manual Clustering (Exploratory approach)

-Unsupervised Clustering - K- means, Hierarchical Clustering

-Elbow Method and Dendrogram Visualization

ðŸ§° **Tech Stack :**

Python | pandas | numpy | matplotlib | seaborn | scikit-learn | Google Colab
